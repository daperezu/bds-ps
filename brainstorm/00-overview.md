## Open Threads

- Should there be a maximum number of items per application? (from #01)
- Should there be a maximum number of suppliers per item beyond the minimum? (from #01)
- Retention policy for abandoned draft applications (from #01)
- Performance score on Applicant: manual, calculated, or deferred? (from #01)
- Constitution needs to be filled in after first implementation (from #01)
- Should pagination page size be configurable or fixed? (from #02)
- Does full item-status reset on send-back create unnecessary re-work for reviewers? (from #02)
- Persistence model for `ApplicantResponse`: durable snapshot vs. reconstructed from item-level state (from #04)
- Representation of `AppealMessage`: child entity with identity vs. value object in a collection on `Appeal` (from #04)
- Whether `ApplicantResponse` decisions should be visible to reviewers in read-only form before an appeal is opened (from #04)
- Terms & Conditions copy ownership and delivery path for the Funding Agreement template (from #05)
- Funder identity shape: single configuration block vs. richer `Funder` aggregate for multi-funder scenarios (from #05)
- Reviewer regeneration rights on the Funding Agreement — revalidate during planning when full role-scope is visible (from #05)
- Syncfusion HTML-to-PDF license acquisition and cost — planning/ops coordination prerequisite (from #05)
- Specific default locale code for LatAm formatting (e.g., `es-CO`, `es-MX`) — to be pinned during planning (from #05)
- Formal audit retention policy for generated Funding Agreement PDFs — deferred to a later compliance-driven spec (from #05)
- Side-by-side view of generated agreement vs. signed upload to aid reviewer visual verification (from #06)
- Execution banner or cover page on executed signed PDF (from #06)
- Final upload size limit value for signed PDFs; 20 MB default proposed (from #06)
- Verify spec 005 precision on which role (reviewer vs. approver) can trigger agreement regeneration, so FR-010 has no inherited ambiguity (from #06)
- Administrative back-out of the signing stage — deliberately out-of-scope gap at feature boundary; ops has no supported path until an admin tooling spec exists (from #06)
- Whether unlimited rejection cycles are acceptable long-term, or whether a future reporting/ops-visibility feature should pressure-test the assumption (from #06)
- Automated reviewer assist (content hash, version marker, or side-by-side diff) to catch mismatched signed uploads — currently purely visual (from #06)
- Should pending-count badges ship with the signing wayfinding, or remain a future polish item once inbox volume makes them valuable? (from #07)
- Should `AppealOpen` get its own banner string on the applicant response page, or remain silent as currently specified? (from #07)
- Is the two-click threshold (SC-001) the right long-term bar, or will future volume eventually justify a top-level nav entry for Signing alongside the sub-tabs? (from #07)
- The 006 signing panel partial is assumed to be shape-clean enough to embed on a second host page; if implementation discovers it is not, reshaping it is within 007 scope but may expose further 006 refactors worth tracking (from #07)
- Specific Tabler.io version pin — deferred to planning (latest stable at planning time) (from #08)
- Sidebar default-open vs. default-collapsed on first load — deferred to planning (from #08)
- Whether the absolute "no badges outside `_StatusPill`" rule should permit non-status badges (e.g., quantity counters) — to be revisited if the planning phase surfaces concrete cases (from #08)
- Whether to invest in visual-regression tooling (Playwright screenshot comparison or Percy) before the sweep, or leave manual side-by-side as the v1 visual gate (from #08)
- Whether `_ConfirmDialog` for every destructive action (including draft-item deletes) is the right baseline, or whether specific exceptions should be enumerated (from #08)
- Future spec 009 (communication surface — unified messaging panel) needs its own brainstorm before any implementation (from #08)
- Future spec 010 (notifications & inbox) needs its own brainstorm — likely SignalR (from #08)
- Future spec 011 (localization layer) — when it lands, partials must be checked to ensure no UI copy was embedded during the 008 sweep (from #08)
- Future spec 012 (admin/configuration surface polish) — likely needed once the 008 sweep lands (from #08)
- Applicant demotion in-flight applications: when an Applicant is demoted, what should the original applicant see for their existing applications? Most likely read-only, pin during planning (from #09)
- `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` configuration key shape and Aspire/user-secret wiring — settle precise key path during planning (from #09)
- Sentinel password rotation procedure (post first-deploy) — no in-product rotation in v1; operational runbook needed in the plan (from #09)
- Sentinel-password WARN-log emission ordering — a crash between user-row commit and log-flush could leave the password unrecoverable; plan must specify emit-before-commit or equivalent (from #09)
- Whether the expanded admin-edited-profile scope (first/last/phone for all roles, legal id for Applicants) is right v1 surface or should narrow back to identity-level only (from #09)
- Whether single-role-by-contract is the right call vs single-role-by-UX with a multi-role-capable data model (from #09)
- Future audit log of admin actions — deferred to a future compliance/reporting spec; needs to land when external audit pressure surfaces (from #09)
- Page-size convention reuse from the review queue — pin during planning (from #10)
- CSV export upper-bound numeric value (cited as `e.g., 50,000`) — pin during planning (from #10)
- `DefaultCurrency` configuration key shape and per-environment conventions (mirrors spec 009's `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` decision) — pin during planning (from #10)
- Spec 005 Funding Agreement PDF visual integrity after the one-token currency-code render change — verify with a PDF-snapshot regression or manual visual comparison during planning (from #10)
- `VersionHistory` adequacy for "approved-at" (US5) and "last actor" / "days in current state" (US6) — verify during planning; spec already specifies em-dash fallback if any field is absent (from #10)
- dacpac deployment-step ordering for the `Currency` column add → backfill → NOT NULL tightening — confirm during planning (from #10)
- Whether the per-currency-stack visual density on the dashboard is acceptable across 1–2 currencies, or if a default-currency headline + hover-collapse is preferable when the platform later supports ≥ 3 currencies (from #10)
- Whether the bundled `010 = currency + reports` framing is right, or if reviewers would prefer `010A = currency / 010B = reports` — outcome of formal stakeholder review on `review_brief.md` (from #10)
- Whether v1's four-report bundle (Applications / Applicants / Funded Items / Aging) is the right cut, or if Activity / Status-Transitions or Appeals should swap in for one of the four (from #10)
- Whether the absence of a read-only Auditor sub-role is acceptable for v1 — future spec can add Auditor without breaking 010 (from #10)
- ISO 4217 enforcement of currency codes — deferred; future spec (from #10)
- Historical snapshotting of supplier display names / applicant identities on report rows — deferred; reports always render current relational state (from #10)
- Display brand name selection — Forge / Ascent / keep FundingPlatform — user sign-off gate (from #11)
- Exact hex values for the warm forest green primary + warm amber accent + warm neutrals + warm-retuned status palette — pinned during planning by designer pass (from #11)
- 8 px spacing scale ratios and full type-scale ramp — pinned during planning after density audit on densest surfaces (from #11)
- Tabler `--tblr-*` CSS-variable bridge aggressiveness — inventory pinned during planning (from #11)
- canvas-confetti (or equivalent ≤ 5 KB gz) exact dependency pin — pinned during planning (from #11)
- Visual-regression tooling adoption — recurring open question from #08; defer or now is reviewer feedback (from #11)
- Selector strategy precedence (role/aria vs. data-testid) — pin during planning so all POM rewrites are uniform (from #11)
- Designer source for the 9 illustration SVGs (in-team / commission / adapted-from-open) — affects timeline (from #11)
- Empty-state surface audit — verify the 9-scene set covers all current empty-state usages (from #11)
- Unified event source service vs. query-time stitching for the activity feeds and journey tooltips (from #11)
- Canonical journey-stage mapping owner — extend IStatusDisplayResolver vs. sibling IJourneyStageResolver (from #11)
- Multi-branch journey rendering (Send-back loop AND active Appeal in one application) — visual contract pinned during planning (from #11)
- Reviewer queue activity-feed positioning at ≥ 1440 px (above table vs. right rail) — defaults to "above" (from #11)
- Confirm removing the status-pill column from reviewer queue rows in favor of inline micro journey timeline loses no information (from #11)
- Signing ceremony view-vs-partial choice (FR-044) — pin during planning (from #11)
- Signing ceremony fresh-vs-bookmark mechanism (TempData / query / one-shot session token, FR-047) — pin during planning (from #11)
- Login/Register tone — clean single-CTA vs. light marketing hero — defaults to "clean" (from #11)
- Schema-unchanged constraint escape-hatch protocol via speckit-spex-evolve — protocol established; specific trigger not anticipated (from #11)
- Performance baseline (LCP / TBT) capture timing — must run as planning day-1 task before any code lands (from #11)
- Future spec 012 (notifications & inbox / SignalR) needs its own brainstorm — spec 011 deliberately excludes real-time push (from #11)
- Future spec 013 (communication surface — unified messaging panel) still pending its own brainstorm (from #11; carries forward from #08)
- Future spec 014 (localization layer) — voice-guide rewrites in spec 011 must keep copy out of partials' code paths (from #11; carries forward from #08)
- Future spec 015 (public marketing surface) — distinct workstream; this brainstorm explicitly chose authenticated-only for spec 011 (from #11)

## Closed Threads

- Will version history be sufficient for audit needs, or will the Appeal spec need a Resolution entity? (from #02) — **Closed by #04**: no `Resolution` entity needed; appeal resolution is a state transition + audit entry.
- Post-signature regeneration lockout on the Funding Agreement (from #05) — **Closed by #06**: resolved as "regeneration permitted until first signed upload; locked thereafter; administrative back-out explicitly out of scope for this feature."
- Operational visibility for stuck applications with no deadlines — likely future reporting spec (from #04) — **Closed by #10**: Aging Applications report (US6) ships in spec 010, with configurable threshold (default 14 days, range 1–365) and per-row drill-in including "days in current state" and "last actor".

## Parked Ideas

None.
